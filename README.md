# Pixo-python3
Pixel art maker🎨❤️! Not Editor:wrench::heavy_exclamation_mark:

# What does it do?
Pixo is a simple pixel art maker. You can make pixel art in it, but you can't edit any.

# Why this is useful?
I started writing pixo because it was a great way to learn something new. I learned a lot of things while making it.
I don't know how useful is this(there are a lot of better pixel art makers out there!😄), but if you want to learn something and help improve this, just hop in! 😄:wrench::computer::octocat:
